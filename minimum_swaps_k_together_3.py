#Given an array and a range a, b. The task is to partition the array around the range such that the array is divided into three parts.
#1) All elements smaller than a come first.
#2) All elements in range a to b come next.
#3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
#The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.

#Note: The generated output is true if you modify the given array successfully. Otherwise false.

#Geeky Challenge: Solve this problem in O(n) time complexity.

#Examples:

#Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], a = 1, b = 2
#Output: true
#Explanation: One possible arrangement is: {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. If you return a valid arrangement, output will be true.
#Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1], a = 1, b = 3
#Output: true
#Explanation: One possible arrangement is: {1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 6}. If you return a valid arrangement, output will be true.
#Constraints:
#1 <= arr.size()<= 106
#1 <= array[i], a, b <= 109
